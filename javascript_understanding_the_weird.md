# Javascript Understanding the Weird

### Syntax Parsers
The first function of syntax analysis (parsing) is to verify whether the source program is syntactically well-formed (i.e., correct).  The parser obtains a string of tokens from the scanner (generated by a scanner definition file as shown above) and verifies that the string can be generated by the grammar for the source language.  (If not, the source program is not syntactically correct.)

The output from the parser is assumed to be a representation of the parse tree (example shown above) for the stream of tokens produced by the scanner.

There are many approaches to parsing, including both top-down and bottom-up approaches, as well as using leftmost or rightmost derivation.  The LR parsing method discussed uses a bottom-up approach to construct a rightmost derivation.

### Lexical Environment
Lexical Environment of a part of code signifies where it is written and what it is surrounded by.

### Execution Context
There are lots of lexical environments. Which one is currently running is managed via execution contexts.
It can contain things beyond what you've written in your code.

**It's important**

### Name / Value Pairs
There is a name, and it is assigned a value
eg
```Python
Address = '100 Main St.'
```

### Object:
Object is a collection of name value pairs.
Name can have other list of Name value pairs

## Global
There a global object in every lexical environment, `this` references to that global object.
Code not inside any function belongs to global.

```Javascript
var a = 5

function b() {

}

console.log(this)
```

a and b will be members of global object.
```Javascript
Window {window: Window, self: Window, document: document, name: "", location: Location, …}
EmberENV: {_DEBUG_RENDER_TREE: true}
GetParams: ƒ (t)
a: 5 <=
alert: ƒ alert()
atob: ƒ atob()
b: ƒ b() <=
blur: ƒ blur()
btoa: ƒ btoa()
caches: CacheStorage {}
cancelAnimationFrame: ƒ cancelAnimationFrame()
cancelIdleCallback: ƒ cancelIdleCallback()
captureEvents: ƒ captureEvents()
chrome: {loadTimes: ƒ, csi: ƒ}
clearInterval: ƒ clearInterval()
clearTimeout: ƒ clearTimeout()
clientInformation: Nav
```
